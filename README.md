# SheHacksProject2021

Our submission to SheHacksV in the prize categories: TD Green Hack Challenge, Best Game, Best Overall, and Neutral Best Sustainability Hack.

Which Bin? is a video game designed to encourage proper waste sorting among middle and high school students in an appealing and entertaining fashion. 
Players are shown images of common types of waste and must determine if it belongs in the recycling, garbage, or compost bins within the specified amount of time. 
But be careful, for the further the player progresses, the less time they have to sort their trash appropriately. 
If the player takes too long to respond or sorts their trash in the wrong bin, then it's game over.

Start the game by running the Run.java file or the executable Run.jar file in WhichBin.zip.

Thanks for playing!
